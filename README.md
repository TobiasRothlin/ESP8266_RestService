# Rest Service EPS8266

## Context:
Philips Hue smart lamps have been steadily rising in popularity. As I replaced my traditional light bulbs with new Philips Hue lamps, I ran into the problem that my traditional light switches did no longer work with the new lamps. As these switches turn of power to the lamp and so the lamp cannot be turned on from the app.

## Task:
The traditional lamp switches have to be adapted to work with the Philips Hue lamps. Traditional lamp switches function like toggle buttons and the lamp functions as a state indicator. As an example, if the light is turned on and the button is pressed the light must be turned off.
